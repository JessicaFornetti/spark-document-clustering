# spark-document-clustering

This project uses Apache Spark to cluster similar documents together so that documents sharing the same theme are placed in the same group and documents on very different topics are placed in separate groups. The following dataset is used : [20 Newsgroups Dataset](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/).

This project was completed as part of the course Machine Learning for Data Science at University Paris Cit√©, France. Therefore the comments and analysis are written in French.
